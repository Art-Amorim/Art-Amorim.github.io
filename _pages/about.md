I'm a Ph.D. student in Computer Science at the University of Central Florida, advised by [Dr. Gary T. Leavens](https://www.cs.ucf.edu/~leavens/homepage.html). My research focuses on developing **formal methods** for ensuring the **security and resilience of critical infrastructure systems**, especially in **cyber-physical systems (CPS)** and **unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs)**.

With a strong foundation in **mathematical logic**, I am passionate about bridging **theory and practice** to address real-world security challenges. I specialize in **software verification**, **programming languages**, and **formal reasoning**, with hands-on experience using tools like **Coq**, **F\***, and **Haskell**.

As a research intern at the **Idaho National Laboratory (INL)** in the National & Homeland Security directorate, I work on the intersection of **runtime verification** and **provable security**. My primary research project centers around **DATUM**, a formal protocol stack that integrates **dynamic attestation** and **multiparty session types** to secure vulnerable systems. DATUM underpins several of my recent works:

- **Securing MAVLink communication in UAVs** by enforcing safe message sequences and preventing stealthy attacks.
- **Isolating runtime components** with microkernel architectures like **seL4** to prevent system-wide compromise.
- **Formalizing industrial control system protocols** using an embedded DSL in an interactive theorem prover, ensuring provable guarantees even in adversarial settings.

My research has been published and presented at top-tier venues, including **ICSS'24**, **DICE'25**, **ICUAS'25**, **NFM'25**, and **HCSS'25**.
